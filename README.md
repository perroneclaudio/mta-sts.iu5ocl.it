This repository contains the MTA-STS policy for comune.sangimignano.si.it.

Alias github page: https://mta-sts.comune.sangimignano.si.it/.well-known/mta-sts.txt

The file named .nojekyll is used to tell GitHub Pages to skip its default Jekyll processing and instead publish the page as a plain HTML site, because I need to host the file exactly as it is, without any kind of processing.
